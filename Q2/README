Then, in 4 different terminal windows, run the four generated exeutables
Run server first, followed by relay1 and relay2, and then finally client
Note that relay1 and relay2 will timeout and exit if client does not send a message within 10 seconds (hash defined timer in data.h, can be changed)
Client and Server will accept a single command-line argument which is the input/output filename respectively. If not provided, client will use "input.txt" and server will use "output.txt"
