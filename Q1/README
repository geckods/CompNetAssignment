README - Question 1

FILES:
client.c
server.c
data.h (contains packet definition, as well as many #define parameters)
functions.c (contains many auxillary functions used by the programs)

RUNNING INSTURCTIONS:
gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c

Then, in 2 different terminal windows, run the two generated exeutables
Run server first, followed  client
Client and Server will accept a single command-line argument which is the input/output filename respectively. If not provided, client will use "input.txt" and server will use "output.txt"

For unknown reasons, if the server is re-run very soon after a previous instance was terminated, you may receive an "Error while binding". This should go away by itself in a minute or so.
